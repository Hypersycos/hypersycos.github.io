RogueFrame (better name pending..) is a prototype for a class-based horde shooter. It aims to have fast-paced, engaging gunplay and abilities, while also having rich class customisation. Implemented in Unity.

SpellCast is a prototype for a competitive arena game, implemented in Unity. Both teams race to destroy a central objective, unlocked by completing individual objectives unique to each class.

### [MEGANAUGHTSANDCROSSES](https://github.com/Hypersycos/MEGANOUGHTSANDCROSSES)
![Image of MEGANAUGHTSANDCROSSES gameplay]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/MEGANAUGHTSANDCROSSES.webp)
A game of naughts and crosses, played with sub-grids of naughts and crosses. Playing a position in a sub-grid forces your opponent to play in the corresponding sub-grid. Fully networked, implemented in pygame.

### [3D Naughts and Crosses](https://github.com/Hypersycos/3D-Noughts-and-Crosses)
![Image of 3D Naughts and Crosses gameplay]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/3DNaughtsAndCrosses.webp)
Multiple naughts and crosses grids stacked on top of each other, allowing for 2+ players to compete. Many aspects can be modified, and it can be played in true 3D or the more traditional side-by-side 2D view. Implemented in pygame.

## Game-related {#game-related}  

### [Arkshot Mods](https://github.com/Hypersycos?tab=repositories&q=Arkshot)
My mods include a framework for networking mod configurations across lobbies, a mod to change all stamina costs and boons, as well as one which uncaps the max player count. This allows players to play with the original competitive vision, or a more chaotic arcade-y style.

### [Incremental Backup](https://github.com/Hypersycos/IncrementalBackup)
Incremental Backup is a java implementation of an incremental backup engine. It was created with the aim of allowing frequent backups of a minecraft server, and as such has an implementation of a .MCA file handler. It's completely modular, and capable of handling any file - though for better results more specific handlers should be used.
